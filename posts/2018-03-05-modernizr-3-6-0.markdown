Sorry, we promised we would not be quietly updating the library again but here we are again. But the good news: we are not
dead yet. And two new feature detects are in this release, one for the focus-within pseudo-selector and one for variable fonts.

Happy developing in 2018!

**New Feature Detect(s)**
- [@oliverjash](https://github.com/oliverjash) added test for CSS `:focus-within` pseudo-selector [#2287](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/2287)
- [@patrickkettner](https://github.com/patrickkettner) added test for variable fonts [#2202](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/2202)

**Fixes**

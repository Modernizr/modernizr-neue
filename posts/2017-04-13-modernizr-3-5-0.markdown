Instead of quietly updating the library like we did for our 3.4.0 release (yes, that happened â€” [see the full changelog here](https://modernizr.com/news/modernizr-3-4-0)), we have an exciting new feature detect as part of 3.5.0: CSS Grids!

With browsers [adding support for CSS Grids in their latest releases](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), the time to [start using CSS Grids](https://alistapart.com/article/practical-grid) is truly here. Just one caveat: IE11 and current shipping versions of Edge do not support the new syntax, but _do_ support the old legacy CSS Grids proposalâ€”and only one of them supports, uh, `@supports`.

So in **3.5.0** weâ€™re adding two tests in one: the now-standard official CSS Grid syntax as `Modernizr.cssgrid`, and the old proposalâ€™s syntax as `Modernizr.cssgridlegacy`. There is also an additional polyfill available for the Pointer Events test, named PEP. Lastly, dependencies were updated.

Happy developing!

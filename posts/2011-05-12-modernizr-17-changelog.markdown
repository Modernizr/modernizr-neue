title:  Modernizr 1.7 changelog
author: Team Modernizr

We put 1.7 live some time ago but never got around to publishing a changelog. Since people have been asking, below are the core changes. For an exact changelog, see the <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/compare/v1.6...v1.7">commit log on GitHub between 1.6 and 1.7</a>.

At the heart of 1.7 are the following major changes:

 * A weaker, less crash-prone test for WebGL
 * A fix for @font-face in certain browsers
 * Faster Drag &amp; Drop test
 * Updated IE Print Protector for better speed and reliability
 * One less content reflow&nbsp;due to better className setting

Beyond these main changes, 1.7 fixes lots of small bugs like tiny memory leaks and the occasional false returns in certain browsers.&nbsp;

A small update on the Modernizr 2 front: we&rsquo;re getting very close to releasing it, so if you encounter any major bugs using either 1.7 or the <a href="http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/2.0-beta/">2.0 beta builder</a>, please <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues">report them on GitHub</a>&nbsp;as soon as possible. We already have a lot of issues and features pushed to our planned 2.1 release, but would love to make sure that the 2.0 release is the absolute best version of Modernizr yet.

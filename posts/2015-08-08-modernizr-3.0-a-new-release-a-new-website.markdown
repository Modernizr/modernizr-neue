title:  "Modernizr 3.0! A new release, a new website!"
author: Modernizr
---

After what appears an eternity to us and the wider development community we are ecstatic to announce the release of Modernizr 3.0! This is a massive release and from our last release almost 2.5 years have passed - an unacceptable timeline. We plan to fix this and have faster releases where it makes sense.

### What's changed?

A lot! We restructured how we write our detects, we no longer have the concept of core tests and we redesigned and built the site from the ground up to give the website a refresh as well as make the builder a whole lot more powerful for beginners and advanced users. From just creating a simple build to grabbing a config, to implementing in your build process, through to a really cool solution of dynamically creating a custom package that can be installed via bower.

A long with an internal restructure we’ve had over 100 new detects added by the community!.

### Modernizr changes:

* The internal structure of Modernizr has been completely revamped, making it easier to contribute to and easier to customise/extend
* Modernizr is no longer available under a BSD licence; only MIT ([#679](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/679))

### Detects

* 99 new detects and counting (see[ #1230](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1230) for the full list)
* No detect names are hyphenated anymore; e.g. battery-api → batteryapi, flexbox-legacy → flexboxlegacy, etc ([#719](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/719),[ #782](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/782))
* Modernizr.contentsecuritypolicy has been removed, as the JS API it was testing is deprecated ([#1461](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1461))
* Modernizr.touch has been removed in favour of touchevents and pointerevents ([#548](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/548))
* Modernizr.pointerevents now detects DOM PointerEvent support, rather than CSS pointer-events ([#800](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/800))
* Detect for CSS pointer-events is now called csspointerevents ([#800](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/800))
* Fixed false-positives in fontface detect ([#1147](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1147))
* Our tests for Flexbox have been revised to better match developers’ expectations:
    * Modernizr.flexbox returns true if flex-basis is supported – which represents a "reasonable" modern spec implementation (Chrome, FF, Safari and IE11 all pass this)
    * Modernizr.flexwrap has been added to detect features missing from Firefox’s implementation
    * Modernizr.flexboxtweener has been added to detect the implementation used by IE10
    * Modernizr.flexboxlegacy remains unchanged
* webgl detect is now more reliable, using[ HTMLCanvasElement.supportsContext()](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-html51-20130528/embedded-content-0.html#dom-canvas-supportscontext) where available ([#689](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/689))
* WebGL extension enumerations are now attached to Modernizr.webglextensions rather than Modernizr.webgl
* datauri detect now has a .over32kb subproperty which will be true if the browser supports data URIs longer than 32 kB ([#321](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/321))
* audio detect now also checks support for the[ Ogg Opus](http://www.opus-codec.org/) codec, exposed as Modernizr.audio.opus ([#699](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/699))
* audiodata detect has been removed, because the implementation was very poor; this spec has been deprecated in favour of the Web Audio API ([#1019](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1019))
* video detect now has an hls subproperty representing support for the[ HLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) video format ([#1317](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1317))
* todataurljpeg, todataurlpng and todataurlwebp are no longer asynchronous ([#802](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/802))
* fullscreen detect has been updated to use window.exitFullScreen rather than window.cancelFullScreen as per[ the latest spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/fullscreen/) ([#739](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/739))
* indexeddb detect now has a deletedatabase subproperty, representing support for the indexedDB.deleteDatabase() method which isn’t implemented in some browsers ([#1238](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1238))
* webp detect now has lossy, lossless and alpha subproperties, representing support for various variants of the WebP format; the root webp property still represents basic lossy support ([#1229](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1229))
* Fixed a bug in cssvwunit, cssvminunit and cssvmaxunit which could give incorrect results when scrollbars are present ([#1045](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1045))
* Fixed a bug in emoji detect where the test could stop working once minified ([#899](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/899))
* Fixed a bug in regions detect where wrong result could be given when page is zoomed ([#940](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/940))
* Fixed a bug in csstransforms3d detect where wrong result could be given when page is zoomed ([#760](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/760))
* Fixed a false-positive for the cssscrollbar detect in IE9 ([#698](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/698))
* Fixed a bug where indexeddb would throw an error if indexedDB was disabled via a browser flag ([#798](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/798))
* Fixed various false-positives in fileinput detect ([#772](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/772))
* Fixed various incorrect results in history detect ([#733](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/733),[ #1471](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1471))
* Fixed a false-positive for cookies detect in IE9 ([#666](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/666))
* Fixed a false-negative for csstransforms3d in WebKit browsers when certain styles are present on the page ([#740](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/740))
* Fixed a bug where a page reload could crash Safari 5.1 ([#524](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/524))
* Fixed cssmask detect (a typo meant it was ineffective) ([#671](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/671))
* Fixed userselect detect (a typo meant it was ineffective) ([#671](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/671))
* Fixed a bug in displaytable detect when page is in RTL ([#716](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/716))
* Improved accuracy of xhr2 detect in Firefox 3.6 ([#1178](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1178))
* Improved accuracy of customprotocolhandler detect in Android 2.x ([#992](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/992))
* Blacklisted Android 1.x & 2.x from passing the csstransforms detect, because it’s excessively buggy ([#903](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/903))
* Fixed backgroundblendmode detect ([#1420](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1420))

### APIs

* Modernizr used to include a Function.prototype.bind polyfill (this was documented, but was somewhat hidden); this has been removed ([#1278](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1278))
* testProp(), testAllProps() and prefixed() now use[ CSS.supports()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS.supports) under the hood for most CSS feature detects where available, improving performance and accuracy ([#818](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/818))
* Modernizr.load has been deprecated in favour of using[ yepnope.js](http://yepnopejs.com) directly; from v3.0, yepnope.js must be included in the page in order for Modernizr.load to work: calling .load() will simply pass the arguments on to yepnope(); this will be removed fully in a future release ([#1241](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1241))
* New Modernizr.on() API, for handling asynchronous detects ([#622](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/622))
* New prefixedCSS() API, which functions like prefixed() but returns the prefixed property name in kebab-case (hyphenated, as used in CSS) instead of camelCase ([#848](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/848))
* testProp(), testAllProps(), prefixed() and prefixedCSS() now accept property names in either camelCase or kebab-case; for prefixed*() the format of the response depends on which function you call: prefixed() always returns camelCase, prefixedCSS() always returns kebab-case) ([#848](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/848))
* New noPrefixes build option, which forces feature detects to only return true if the feature is supported *without* a vendor prefix ([#1082](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1082))
* New enableJSClass build option, which determines whether or not to add js/no-js classes to the <html> element when Modernizr runs; true by default ([#1385](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1385))
* hasEvent() previously used "appropriate" elements for certain tests: submit would be tested against a <form> element, error would be tested against an <img> element, etc; this is no longer the case – for consistency, all will be tested against a <div>, unless otherwise specified by the optional elem argument ([#636](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/636))
* hasEvent()'s optional elem argument can now be an element *or* simply a tag name, e.g. Modernizr.hasEvent('click', 'a') ([#636](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/636))
* If a classPrefix is specified as a build option, it will be applied to no-js/js classes as well (previously this only applied to feature classes) ([#1031](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1031))
* Fixed a bug where classPrefix wasn’t applied to the class set for the first-executed feature detect ([#1053](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1053))
* testProp() and testAllProps() now accept up to 3 arguments: testProp(prop, [value, [skipValueTest]]); if a value is provided, Modernizr will ensure that value is supported for the named CSS property, delegating to CSS.supports() where available; if skipValueTest is true (default is false), the value test won’t be conducted when CSS.supports() *isn’t* available
* addTest() will now set subproperties if given a property name containing a period (.), which can be used for defining custom structured detects, or for extending existing detects (e.g. adding custom codec detects to Modernizr.audio) ([#1089](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1089)) **_(buggy:_****_[ #135_**5](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1355)**_)_**
* Fixed a bug where calling Modernizr.prefixed() with an obj argument which doesn’t support binding would throw an exception ([#1014](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/1014))
* Fixed a bug where calling Modernizr.mq() inside a hidden iframe would throw an error in Firefox ([#886](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/886))

### The website

We started out revamping the builder to make it easier to find the detects you needed and evolved into a complete revamp of the website.

Some things to point out:

* The website uses service workers so after you’ve created your build in theory you can do the same offline
* You can search for a detect in real time on the download page.
* Each detect now has a special comment that we parse and display on the download page, with handy information about the detect including polyfills and links.
* Best of all it’s open source so if you find issues please report or fix them!

### Thanks

Of course we can't thank the community enough for their massive contributions to Modernizr 3.0 all 86 of them!

A few worthy call outs, Patrick Kettner who came in and contributed an enormous amount of effort and work to get 3.0 to the state it is, without him we wouldn't of got to this release. Stu Cox who also came onto the scene and contributed a huge amount of work and Joe Critchley who took on updating the look and feel of the our new shiny website.

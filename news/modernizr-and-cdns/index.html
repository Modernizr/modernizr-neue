Back in the 1.x days this made a fair bit of sense: there was only one version of the library, and so the compressed version would be useful to have on a CDN for performance reasons.</p><p>With the advent of Modernizr 2, however we&rsquo;ve (re)introduced modular builds of the library, which make the value of CDNs less self-evident. We now make you create a customized build of Modernizr&mdash;using only the tests you actually need&mdash;when you want a production-ready, minified &amp; compressed version of the library. But with over 40 embedded tests, supporting all possible combinations of tests is impossible, aside of being downright undesirable.</p><p>This has caused some confusion, so we&rsquo;d like to explain the right way to use Modernizr under the various different scenarios that occur.</p><h3 id=development>Development, local: General development and/or learning</h3><p>When you start building a new project, or if you simply want to learn, you should download <a href=http://www.modernizr.com/downloads/modernizr-latest.js>the latest development version of Modernizr</a>. This is typically a stage where you don&rsquo;t know yet which feature detection tests you&rsquo;ll eventually need by the time you go to production, and don&rsquo;t need to worry about minification. If you&rsquo;re building your site or app locally, this is the version to use.</p><h3 id=special>Development + CDN: Test cases, one-offs, partial control-situations</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re creating a quick test case using something like <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/ >jsfiddle</a>, or are writing an entry for a contest like <a href=http://10k.aneventapart.com/ >10K Apart</a>, using a CDN can be not just useful, but downright necessary. If your situation relies on externally-hosted code, use one of the CDN releases.</p><p>But be warned: <em>these versions contain all 40+ tests!</em> That means they are full-fledged libraries with almost certainly a lot of things you don&rsquo;t need in a final product.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why the <a href=http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/cdn.ashx#Modernizr_Releases_on_the_CDN_5>Microsoft CDN</a> and <a href=http://www.cdnjs.com/#/search/modernizr>CDNJS</a> releases of Modernizr are essentially just Development versions, but hosted somewhere for you to use.</p><h3 id=production>Custom build: All production uses</h3><p>Are you priming your website or app for production? Then it&rsquo;s time to head over to <a href=http://www.modernizr.com/download/ >the custom download builder</a>, tick all the tests your project makes use of, and hit that Generate button to make your own special build.</p><p><strong>All production uses of Modernizr should be using a latest custom build from the site.</strong> This ensures that you won&rsquo;t run into any (old) bugs, and will have the absolute minimum amount of code and execution time needed for the best possible performance.</p><p>As an added bonus, these custom builds now include a directly-usable Build link that allow you to make small tweaks&mdash;change a setting here or there&mdash;without having to figure out your requirements all over again. It&rsquo;s also helpful whenever a new stable build is released: just revisit that Build link from your custom build&rsquo;s source, hit Generate again and you have a new, updated stable build. Always be sure to test!</p><p>We hope this simple guide helps you figure out when to use what version of Modernizr.</p><div class=blogpost-links><a class="blogpost-link blogpost-link-prev" href=/news/modernizr-2>Modernizr 2</a><a class="blogpost-link blogpost-link-next" href=/news/modernizr-test-suite>How Does Modernizrâ€™s Test Suite Work?</a></div></article></main><footer role=contentinfo class=footer><div class=footer-links><p>Made with love by <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/KuraFire>Faruk</a>, <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/paul_irish>Paul</a>, <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/SlexAxton>Alex</a>, <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/ryanseddon>Ryan</a>, <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/patrickkettner>Patrick</a>, <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/stucoxmedia>Stu</a>, and <a class=teamMember href=https://twitter.com/doctyper>Richard</a>.</p><p><a target=_blank href=/feed>Subscribe to the feed</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/Modernizr>follow on twitter</a>, or <a href=https://paulirish.wufoo.com/forms/p1hsxsru1ohiv0u/ >contact&nbsp;us</a>. <a href=https://www.paypal.me/modernizr/25>Donations are cool, too</a>.</p></div><a class=hiddentext title="Check out the code on github" href=https://github.com/modernizr/modernizr>Check out the code on github</a></footer><script async src=/js/build.js></script><script async>!function(e,a,t,n,g,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=g,e.ga=e.ga||function(){(e.ga.q=e.ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},e.ga.l=1*new Date,c=a.createElement(t),o=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],c.async=1,c.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script",0,"ga"),ga("create","UA-3764464-7","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
